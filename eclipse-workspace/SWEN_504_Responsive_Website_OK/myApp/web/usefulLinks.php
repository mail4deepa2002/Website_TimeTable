</div>
<div class="story_text">
  <p><a href="http://www.starfall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.starfall.com</a> is one of the largest and best educational websites around. If you&#8217;re a parent, then chances are you&#8217;ve already come across this great website. It comes in at number 2, as it&#8217;s starting to look a little dated, and some of the gameplay can be a little tedious.</p>
  <p>Starfall teaches through play, with hundreds of games in categories like reading, writing, maths, etc. The screenplay is straightforward, with simple, colourful graphics. The emphasis here is on the learning, rather than the gaming. You can download the app, and sign up to access even more of the website. The cost is just $35 for a whole year, and well worth it for the depth of games you get. If you want to use the desktop version, you&#8217;ll need to use Adobe Flash, which is being phased out by 2020.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.natgeokids.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.natgeokids.com</a> is probably our favourite website on this list. It comes in at the number 3 spot though, as the content is pitched for older kids, probably 10 and up, and not all kids will be into the content offered here.</p>
  <p>National Geo for Kids is big on education, and the site is full of information about the world around us, from China, to dinosaurs, to space missions, and everything in between! It&#8217;s like an online magazine for kids, full of articles, and competitions, and educational videos. One of the best things about Nat Geo for Kids is that they regularly update it with new information, which is great. For kids that love to read and learn about the world around them, this site will keep them busy for months! We did notice some sponsored content on the website, although it was very kid-friendly advertising.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/kidsclub/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.nasa.gov/kidsclub</a> is the go-to website for all those space-enthusiasts out there. If your kids are into spaceships, mars rovers and comets then this is the website to check out.</p>
  <p>The actual Kidsclub section is fairly limited, although very educational, and simple to use. But if this section doesn&#8217;t meet the space needs for your little future Buzz Aldrin, they can click through to all the great NASA website resources, like images of the day, Nasa TV, and all the present and past NASA missions. Some of the gameplay is based on Adobe Flash, which is being phased out by 2020. It may also not work correctly on a mobile device.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.youngoceanexplorers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.youngoceanexplorers.com</a> is an amazing website made by a Father and Daughter team from New Zealand. If your kids are into the deep blue sea, rather than the skies above, this is your new go-to website.</p>
  <p>Steve and Riley bring the ocean direct to your child&#8217;s computer with high-quality, fact-filled videos. With a strong emphasis on environmental education, this Father-Daughter duo go all out to capture some great video content. With articles like <a href="http://www.youngoceanexplorers.com/yoe/video/214335949119#cplayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What eats turtles</a>? <a href="http://www.youngoceanexplorers.com/yoe/video/213373819019#cplayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Do dolphins drink water</a>? and <a href="http://www.youngoceanexplorers.com/yoe/video/213373825953#cplayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can a girl fish become a boy fish</a>? this website answers everything you ever wanted to know about the ocean. There&#8217;s more Dad-jokes than you can shake a sea-sponge at, but don&#8217;t let that put you off. If Steve&#8217;s Dad-jokes &#8216;flounder&#8217; a little, Riley jumps in to prevent a &#8216;ship-wreck&#8217; (did you see what I did there!).</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.shaunsgameacademy.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.shaunsgameacademy.co.uk</a> is an awesome free resource developed by Aardman Animations, makers of the Shaun the Sheep animated movie. The Game Academy teaches children how to code games using the amazing Scratch software. This helps remove some of the significant learning curve involved in using Scratch.</p>
  <p>Coding is fast becoming a fundamental skillset, and some of the skills coding develops help with core curriculum development. Skills like problem solving, analytical thinking, logic and creativity are all pushed to the limit when coding games. What&#8217;s more, actual coding skills are required in industries such as gaming, animation and computer engineering. So if your child is destined to be Weta Workshop&#8217;s next head of animation, get them coding today!</p>

  <p><a href="http://discoverymindblown.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discoverymindblown.com</a> offers the best of Discovery Family videos and information, along with games, articles and ebooks on everything from dinosaurs, to robotic basketball players.</p>
  <p>Where National Geo for Kids is big on the educational content, Discovery Mindblown is more into edutainment. The videos are packed full of information, but delivered in the very high-quality movie format you&#8217;d expect of Discovery TV. This website also focuses on the shock and awe content, teeth-nashing dinosaurs, killer scorpions, the largest fish in the world, that sort of thing. It&#8217;s unlikely many kids will get bored with this website. But with a video-heavy format, the emphasis is more on being entertained than educated.</p>
